# Malicious URL Detection

This project is designed to detect and classify malicious URLs using machine learning. The model identifies potentially harmful URLs, aiding in cybersecurity by preventing phishing, malware distribution, and other cyber threats.

## Features
- Classifies URLs as safe or malicious
- Utilizes machine learning techniques for detection
- Can be integrated with web applications or standalone for cybersecurity tasks

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Scikit-Learn
- Pandas, Numpy
- Flask (for API integration,)

## Usage
After setting up, run the following command to classify URLs:
python app.py

## Project Workflow
1. **Data Collection:** Collect a dataset of URLs labeled as safe or malicious.
2. **Data Preprocessing:** Clean and preprocess the data for model training.
3. **Feature Extraction:** Extract features such as URL length, domain name, etc.
4. **Model Training:** Train a machine learning model on labeled data.
5. **Prediction:** Use the trained model to classify new URLs as safe or malicious.
